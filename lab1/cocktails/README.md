Hey! This is a cocktail creator!

It randomly creates a cocktail name and selects its ingredients.

To build and run:
* In the parent directory run make:
 * `make dep` if you haven't already
 * `make make-cocktails`
* Run the thing with the number of elements you want
 * `./makeCocktails n`

Love,
Scott
